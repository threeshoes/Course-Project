<h1>Course Project Final

<h3>

The purpose of this project was to create a website of favorite things using the jQuery mobile framework. The website includes a home page with a short description about the content of the site, various forms of navigation, and a link to a contact page. Each page contains a short description of the favorite item, an unordered list of accomplishments and facts, a back button at the top left to return to the previous page, and a navigation button that opens a penel containing links for navigation. 

Finally, the contact page contains a basic form including first and last name, email, and a textarea for leaving some random information. On the right side of the page is a list of the favorite items and if you press the save button it will add the text from the textarea to the list. Pressing the reset button will clear the item from the list and clear the form fields. The submit button is just there for show and does not actually do anything.
